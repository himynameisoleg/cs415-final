        Our proposed project is to build a movie database that allows users to search for a film by title, actor, director, genre, release year, total gross, runtime and its IMDB rating. This database, through its GUI, will allow users to search for films as part of a large table, or to filter their options with the available criteria. Users will also be able to create a personal profile where they can save selected films to favorites. This project requires a database so users can search and sort through large amounts of information (the films) and make selections based on their own criteria. We intend to develop our program using Python.
